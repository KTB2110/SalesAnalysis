# Sales Data Analysis

Welcome to the Sales Data Analysis project! Here, we take our sales data and give it a good ol' statistical analysis. We've got 50 CSV files to work with - that's 50 whole weeks of sales data! If only we had 50 weeks of vacation to go with it...

## Getting Started
Anyway, let's get to the questions we need to answer. First up, we need to plot the daily sales for all 50 weeks. Easy peasy, just a quick bit of code and we'll be on our way to some sweet visualizations.

Next, we need to figure out when the sudden change in daily sales occurred. Was it a full moon? Was it the result of a 2-for-1 sale? We may never know the cause, but we can certainly pinpoint the date it happened.

Now, we need to determine whether this sudden change in daily sales is statistically significant. We're not just guessing here - we've got some serious number crunching to do.

Finally, we need to investigate whether the change in daily sales is due to a shift in the proportion of male-vs-female customers. We don't want to make any assumptions here!

## Conclusion
So, buckle up and get ready for some serious data analysis. We're about to find out what makes this company's sales tick, and maybe even have a few laughs along the way (just don't let the boss catch you slacking off).
